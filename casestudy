/*We have been tasked by the DVD Rental Co marketing team to help them generate the analytical inputs required to drive their very first customer email campaign.
The marketing team expects their personalised emails to drive increased sales and engagement from the DVD Rental Co customer base.
The main initiative is to share insights about each customer’s viewing behaviour to demonstrate DVD Rental Co’s relentless focus on customer experience.
