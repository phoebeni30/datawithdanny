Here is the project corner when I have been studying "Data with Danny" course.

I've gone through many case studies to better understand business demands in different categories as well as its driven-data application methods, department demands and the practical approach to train my SQL technique skills.
These are my studying results:
1. Email Marketing case study from DVD Rental Co
2. SQL Weekly Challenges

Let's get started!
